# Password Generator

## Discription

For this assignment/challenge I was asked to create an application that generates a random password using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS was already provided. This assignment was challenging since this was my first crack at JavaScript outside the module. Luckily, I had the resouces from the weekly module "Robot-Gladiator" and also MDN Web doc to help me through certain problems. I've learned to really relay on MDN Web when I get stuck with certain issues.
